NewWave is an easy-to-use UI library, written in VLang, with a focus on simplicity and expandabillity.

Features:
    - Modular component types -> Object ( for rendering ), Container ( for orientation of components ), Reactor ( for interactivity )
    - Expandable file structure
    - custom style sheet implementation in .json format, with the power of style variables.
    - Object oriented component structure

Roadmap:
    - Easy referencing of objects through the ui struct to selected components.
    - More component - individual formatting settings ( text orientation, etc. )
    - More components -> Text Input, Switch, Slider

TODO:
    - Add more commentary to internal functions and components, explaining what they are doing
    - Add Option for internal Component variables to not be able to be set through the style sheet
